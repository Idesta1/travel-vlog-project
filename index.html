 <h3>Cophenhagen: City of Harbor, Where Old Arcitecture meets Modern Design</h3>
 <p>Copenhagen’s origins date back to the early Middle Ages. It was founded as a fishing village in the 10th century. The name “Copenhagen” comes from the Old Danish Køpmannahavn, which means “merchant’s harbor.” The settlement grew in importance during the reign of King Absalon (12th century), who built a fortress on a small island in the city’s harbor, known as Slotsholmen. This fortress helped defend the city and solidified its status as a key location for trade and commerce.



<p>Over time, Copenhagen expanded from a small fishing town to the capital of Denmark in the 15th century. In the 16th century, during the reign of King Frederick II, Copenhagen began to develop into a more fortified city with many of the buildings and structures still in place today, such as the Rosenborg Castle.</p>



<p>By the 17th century, under King Christian IV, Copenhagen became a prominent European city, with infrastructure development, including the construction of the Børsen (Stock Exchange) and the development of the Nyhavn harbor area. The city’s growth was further accelerated by industrialization and trade in the 19th and 20th centuries, solidifying Copenhagen as the cultural and political heart of Denmark.</p>



<p>Today, Copenhagen is a modern, cosmopolitan city, blending its rich history with innovation and sustainability.
